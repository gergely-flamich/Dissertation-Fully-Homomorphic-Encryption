Fully Homomorphic Encryption
================================================================================

The aim of this project is to explore how one may derive a fully homomorphic 
crypto scheme, prove its security with appropriate rigour and implement it.

Setting up the project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code in this repository requires __Sage v8.1__ (or higher) and __Jupyter 
Notebook__ to run installed on the user's machine to run. Once these conditions
are present, to run some example code, navigate to the source folder of the scheme:

```
> cd /path/to/root/Project/<scheme>/src
```

Finally, run the following to start Jupyter:

```
> sage -n jupyter <scheme>_demo.ipynb
```
