    "======================================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we present a basic walkthrough of the cryptosystem invented by Goldreich, Goldwasser and Halevi in 1997 [1].\n",

    "__Note for using Jupyter:__ Use $\\texttt{SHIFT + ENTER}$ to execute the code snippets!\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with some theoretical discussion, in particular, let's see the hardness assumption on which we can base the cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the __$\\gamma(n)$-Closest Vector Problem (CVP)__:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a security parameter $\\lambda = 1^n$, approximation factor $\\gamma(n)$, a PPT adversary $\\mathcal{A}$ and PPT algorithm $\\texttt{GenCVP}$, the CVP experiment is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate $(\\mathbf{u}, P, S) \\leftarrow \\texttt{GenCVP}(\\lambda)$. Here $P, S \\in \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\\mathcal{L}(P) = \\mathcal{L}(S)$ and $\\mathbf{u} \\in \\text{Span}(P)$.\n",
    "2. Run $\\mathbf{v} \\leftarrow \\mathcal{A}(\\mathbf{u},P)$, where $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathcal{L}(S)$\n",
    "3. The adversary succeeds iff $||\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{u}|| \\leq \\gamma(n)\\cdot ||\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{w}||$ for all $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathcal{L}(P)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardness assumption of the above then is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\gamma(n)$-CVP is hard relative to $\\texttt{GenCVP}$ if every adversary succeeds with negligible advantage:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\texttt{Adv}^{\\text{cvp}}_{\\mathcal{A}, \\texttt{GenCVP}}(n) = \n",
    "    2 \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(\\texttt{Expr}^{\\text{cvp}}_{\\mathcal{A}, \\texttt{GenCVP}}(n) - 1 \\leq \\text{negl}(n).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, the CVP assumes that we can generate a lattice basis in PPT, such that given the basis and some vector from the ambient space, it is hard to find the closest lattice vector to the point in the ambient space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trapdoor we can use here follows from a result by Laszlo Babai, who showed given that the vectors of a lattice basis are sufficiently orthogonal to each other (formally, the basis is Lovasz reduced) we always recover the $\\gamma(n)$-closest vector, where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\gamma(n) = 1 + 2n\\cdot\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{n}{2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $n$ being the dimension of the lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we can exploit this by setting the public key as a \"bad\" basis, i.e. one with almost parallel vectors in it and setting the private key as a \"good\" basis, i.e. one with almost orthogonal vectors in it."

We check how orthogonal this basis is by calculating the basis' Hadamard ratio and if it is above a certain threshold, we accept it by setting it as our secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we calculate the Hermite Normal Form (HNF) of our good basis, and set it as our public key. The reason why we do this is because the HNF of any lattice basis always exists, it can be calculated in polynomial time and in a sense it is the \"worst\" possible basis (see [2] for a rigorous explanation).\n",
