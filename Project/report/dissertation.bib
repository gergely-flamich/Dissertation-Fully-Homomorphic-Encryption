abstract="We compare the relative strengths of popular notions of security for public key encryption schemes. We consider the goals of privacy and non-malleability, each under chosen plaintext attack and two kinds of chosen ciphertext attack. For each of the resulting pairs of definitions we prove either an implication (every scheme meeting one notion must meet the other) or a separation (there is a scheme meeting one notion but not the other, assuming the first notion can be met at all). We similarly treat plaintext awareness, a notion of security in the random oracle model. An additional contribution of this paper is a new definition of non-malleability which we believe is simpler than the previous one.",

We prove that each of two straightforward fast heuristic procedures achieves this goal when applied to a lattice given by a Lov{\'a}sz-reduced basis. The verification of one of them requires proving a geometric feature of Lov{\'a}sz-reduced bases: ac                                          1                                      d                                   lower bound on the angle between any member of the basis and the hyperplane generated by the other members, wherec                        1 = {\textsurd}2/3.",

abstract="A class of random lattices is given, in [1] so that (a) a random lattice can be generated in polynomial time together with a short vector in it, and (b) assuming that certain worst-case lattice problems have no polynomial time solutions, there is no polynomial time algorithm which finds a short vector in a random lattice with a polynomially large probability. In this paper we show that lattices of the same random class can be generated not only together with a short vector in them, but also together with a short basis. The existence of a known short basis may make the construction more applicable for cryptographic protocols.",
