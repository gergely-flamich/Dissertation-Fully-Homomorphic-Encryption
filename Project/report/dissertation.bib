abstract="We compare the relative strengths of popular notions of security for public key encryption schemes. We consider the goals of privacy and non-malleability, each under chosen plaintext attack and two kinds of chosen ciphertext attack. For each of the resulting pairs of definitions we prove either an implication (every scheme meeting one notion must meet the other) or a separation (there is a scheme meeting one notion but not the other, assuming the first notion can be met at all). We similarly treat plaintext awareness, a notion of security in the random oracle model. An additional contribution of this paper is a new definition of non-malleability which we believe is simpler than the previous one.",

abstract="A class of random lattices is given, in [1] so that (a) a random lattice can be generated in polynomial time together with a short vector in it, and (b) assuming that certain worst-case lattice problems have no polynomial time solutions, there is no polynomial time algorithm which finds a short vector in a random lattice with a polynomially large probability. In this paper we show that lattices of the same random class can be generated not only together with a short vector in them, but also together with a short basis. The existence of a known short basis may make the construction more applicable for cryptographic protocols.",

Smart and Vercauteren implemented the underlying ``somewhat homomorphic'' scheme, but were not able to implement the bootstrapping functionality that is needed to get the complete scheme to work. We show a number of optimizations that allow us to implement all aspects of the scheme, including the bootstrapping functionality.",

abstract="Homomorphic encryption allows a user to receive encrypted data and to perform arbitrary computation on that data without decrypting it. The homomorphic encryption scheme which supports only a bounded number of homomorphic operations is called ``somewhat homomorphic encryption''. The scheme which supports arbitrary number of homomorphic operations is called ``fully homomorphic encryption''. We need to construct an fully homomorphic encryption scheme which satisfies strong security for practical use to use a homomorphic encryption scheme practically, but essentially, we cannot construct a scheme which satisfies IND-CCA2 security Thus, one of the strongest security notions for homomorphic encryption is IND-CCA1 security. In this paper, we construct an fully homomorphic encryption scheme which satisfies IND-CCA1 security. Our construction has a restriction that our scheme can compute an arbitrary number of operations, but the arity of circuits is bounded. Our construction is based on the leakage-resilient bounded arity fully homomorphic encryption scheme proposed by Berkoff and Liu (TCC 2014). We show that their general construction can work for our construction.",
