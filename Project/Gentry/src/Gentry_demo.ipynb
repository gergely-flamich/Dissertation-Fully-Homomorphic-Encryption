    "Recall the __Ideal Coset Problem__:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a security parameter $\\lambda = 1^n$, a ring $R$ with an ideal $I$, a PPT algorithm $\\texttt{Samp}_R$ that samples $R$ according to some distribution, a PPT algorithm $\\texttt{GenIdeal}$ and a PPT adversary $\\mathcal{A}$, the ICP experiment is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run $\\texttt{GenIdeal}(\\lambda, R, I)$ and obtain a tuple $(J^{pk}, J^{sk})$, two generators of the same ideal $J$ such that $I + J = R$.\n",
    "2. Generate $r_0 \\leftarrow \\texttt{Samp}_R$ and $r_1 \\leftarrow R$ and a bit $b \\leftarrow \\{0, 1\\}$. Then, calculate $r = r_b \\mod J^{pk}$.\n",
    "3. $\\mathcal{A}$ is given $R, I, J^{pk}, \\texttt{Samp}_R$ and $r$ and outputs some bit $b' \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n",
    "4. Set $\\texttt{Expr}^{ICP}_{\\mathcal{A}, R, I, \\texttt{Samp}_R, \\texttt{GenIdeal}}(n) = 1$ if $b = b'$ and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, the ICP asks an adversary to decide whether the coset representative it receives was picked uniformly randomly, or whether it was picked according to some different distribution (defined by $\\texttt{Samp}_R$). This would be impossible if the custom sampling function was also uniform, but the hardness assumption is that there are non-uniform sampling algorithms for which it is still hard to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the __ICP hardness assumption__ says, that the ICP is hard relative to $(R, I ,\\texttt{Samp}_R, \\texttt{GenIdeal})$ if every PPT adversary $\\mathcal{A}$ has negligible probability to succeed, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\texttt{Adv}^{ICP}_{\\mathcal{A}, R, I, \\texttt{Samp}_R, \\texttt{GenIdeal}}(n) = \\left| 2 \\cdot \\texttt{Expr}^{ICP}_{\\mathcal{A}, R, I, \\texttt{Samp}_R, \\texttt{GenIdeal}}(n) - 1 \\right|\\leq \\text{negl}(n).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above might seem really far removed, but it has two advantages:\n",
    "1. It yields a straightforward trapdoor, namely the ideal generators $J^{pk}, J^{sk}$ which will serve as the public and private key.\n",
    "2. We can build a scheme based on the ICP and then prove its security based on it. Then, we can \"substitute in\" something more concrete and be guaranteed a secure scheme! (See Section 9.2.3 in the report.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we pick $R = \\mathbb{Z}[x]/f$, where $f(x) = x^N + 1$ for $\\lambda = 1^n$ and $N = 2^n$. It can be shown that $f$ is irreducible and hence $R$ is a field. Pick $I = (2) \\leq R$. Then, define $\\texttt{GenIdeal}$ so that it picks some $v \\in R$ with its coefficients being between some parameter $t$, such that $v \\not\\in I$. Also define $\\texttt{Samp}_R$ to pick $u \\in R$ such that its coefficients are picked from $\\{0, 1\\}$, with 0 having some probability $p$ and 1 with probability $1 - p$. This will mean that the norm of $u$ will be extremely small."
